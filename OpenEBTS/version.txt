
OpenEBTS Version History
========================


Version 2.0.0.17, February 27th 2014
------------------------------------

* Windows binaries now statically linked to Microsoft runtimes to simplify dissemination.


Version 2.0.0.16, January 31st 2014
-----------------------------------

* Adapted CNISTRecord::GetImageInfo to work with experimental Type-11 Voice Recognition records.
* Made IWStrTok thread-safe so IWRead won't crash in multi threaded environments.
* Addressed memory leak whereby Java function NISTFile.getImageAs leaked an image.
* Added IWCloneVerification / Java NISTFile.associateVerificationFile now clones verification object to ensure complete memory independence between transaction and verification - necessary in Java as various scenarios may cause the GC to free these out of order.
* Logfile now contains threadid for each entry and advanced diagnostic messages around allocation, association and deallocation of transaction and verification objects.


Version 2.0.0.15, November 17th 2013
------------------------------------

* Support for Type-11 Voice Sample using standard IWSetImage/IWGetImage routines and fmtRAW
* OpenEBTSViewer Type-11 support, plays audio for Voice Sample records
* Resolved multi-threading issue when concurrently loading same verification file
* Resolved multi-threading issue when concurrently decompressing WSQ images
* Improved exception handling and logging in a multi-threaded environment
* Windows solution upgraded to Visual Studio 2012


Version 2.0.0.14, September 22nd 2013
-------------------------------------

* Fixed IDC management bug whereby reading-in an existing transaction and appending new records
would create garbage IDC indices.


Version 2.0.0.13, August 11th 2013
----------------------------------

* Fixed very rare problem with 98/99/998/999/9998/9999 etc. byte record lengths where stored
TX_LEN field caused record length to jump by an extra byte
* Extra check for corrupt files during reading (IWRead/IWReadMem)
* OpenEBTSViewer reports error when reading corrupt file


Version 2.0.0.12, July 3rd 2013
-------------------------------

* Photographs now default to Scale Units of 0 to provide pixel aspect of 1:1 instead of providing
image resolution, which rarely is meaningful
* Consolidated image compression factors to always go from 1 (smallest file) to 100 (greatest quality).
This now holds true even for WSQ and JPEG 2000.


Version 2.0.0.11, March 21st 2013
---------------------------------

* Special chars tag (sca) can now take double-quotes as possible values, as long
as they're preceded by backslashes
* Standardization of zero-padded numeric field labels (see CNISTField::GetFieldLabel)
* Fixed multi-MNU ruleset verification bug: when several rules with the same MNU were
defined they were all being applied regardless of which TOT they were associated with.


Version 2.0.0.10, August 14th 2012
----------------------------------

* Added readFromMem and writeToMem to Java class NISTFile


Version 2.0.0.9, June 25th 2012
-------------------------------

* More leniency when validating verification file date format codes to allow wider scope (e.g., "CCYY")
* Allow double-quotes within double-quotes in verification file (when preceded by a backslash)
* BMPtoWSQ now returns IW_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_BIT_DEPTH when input is not 8bpp


Version 2.0.0.8, May 4th 2012
-----------------------------

* Minor bugfix: RemoveSubField() for-loop now more efficient


Version 2.0.0.7, September 29th 2011
------------------------------------

* Properly detect nregex and regex rules. Correct problem where nregex rules were returned as regex.


Version 2.0.0.6, August 15th 2011
---------------------------------

* Image exporting functions now support all formats. Added IWExportImageMem.
* Added Java functions NISTFile.getImageAs and NISTFile.getImageAsToFile.


Version 2.0.0.5, June 12th 2011
-------------------------------

* Reorganization and streamlining of serialization code
* Configurable logging to file via environment variables
* Update to "Guide to Building and Installing OpenEBTS" (logging)
* Added associateVerificationFile(NISTVerification ver) to Java OpenEBTS class


Version 2.0.0.4, April 10th 2011
--------------------------------

* JNI wrappers and Java classes for OpenEBTS.
* Java samples demonstrating object-oriented classes.
* OpenEBTS port to Android.
* Android activity samples.


Version 2.0.0.3, March 23rd 2011
--------------------------------

* Minor tweaks:
* Standardized interface to C by replacing few bools with ints.
* Added IWGetNumFields to avoid looping through all fields to get count.
* Dealt with NULL input params smartly for IWGetTransactionTypes and IWGetMnemonics.
* Removed Boost library from OpenEBTS, replaced Regex code with custom parsing.


Version 2.0.0.2, March 4th 2011
--------------------------------
* Now also supported on 64-bit Linux. There are now 8 flavours of OpenEBTS
based on Windows vs. Linux, MBCS vs. UNICODE, and 32-bit versus 64-bit.


Version 2.0.0.1, February 28th 2011
-----------------------------------
* Now also supported on Windows x64.


Version 2.0.0.0, February 5th 2011
----------------------------------
* Now also supported on Linux.


Versions 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.0.38, 2009-2010
--------------------------------------
* Main feature development of OpenEBTS, supported on 32-bit Windows.
